# Laboratory Reservation System
The purpose of this project is to develop an application for laboratory reservations, specifically for the laboratories in the systems area of the Universidad Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito. This application will allow users to reserve each laboratory within the permitted schedule, as well as cancel reservations if necessary, and consult any type of information about each laboratory they need, all through a user-friendly and intuitive web interface. This repository is specifically for the Backend area; if you want to check the status of the front, follow this link: https://github.com/Waldron63/SunTeaBack

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Package
When making the folder, we had in mind a clear organization for each element of the front end.
* assets: they contain both images used and css files.
* components: each defined component is contained in this folder.
* pages: all the .jsx files that are related to an already established CRUD functionality.
* routes: works for security and protected routes.
* services: all the services defined in back

# Important Elements
### Components
It is a reusable block of code that encapsulates logic and presentation of the user interface.
