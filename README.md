# Laboratory Reservation System

### The purpose of this project is to develop an application for laboratory reservations, specifically for the laboratories in the systems area of the Universidad Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito. This application will allow users to reserve each laboratory within the permitted schedule, as well as cancel reservations if necessary, and consult any type of information about each laboratory they need, all through a user-friendly and intuitive web interface. This repository is specifically for the Frontend area; if you want to check the status of the backend, follow this link: https://github.com/Waldron63/SunTeaBack
